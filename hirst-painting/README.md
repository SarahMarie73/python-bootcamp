# Hirst Painting
Continued on Day 18 of the 100 Days of Code - Python Bootcamp course on Udemy, working with the colorgram module and turtle to recreate a Hirst painting.

When I was done, I watched the solution video and I found she wrote it differently...but I actually think my way of writing the code was better. She wrote it with a dot count, modulo, for loop, etc. and using the heading method of turtle. It produced a lot more lines of code. I feel my version is a bit more succinct.

Overall I think I did really well with this challenge and did not need to use hints.

## Key concepts
- Tuples and random
- Turtle module

## Challenges experienced

One of the big challenges I had was getting the dots to be random colors using the rgb values. After doing some research on stackoverflow, I realized I needed to set the colormode to 255. Also, it was not working when I was just importing Turtle and Screen from the turtle module. I had to import the whole turtle module in order to get the colormode to work.
