# Pong Game

### 08-07-2023:

Today I started working on the Pong game project. First, I created the screen for the game with the usual setup and set the size and color.

Next, I created the Paddle class which inherits from the Turtle class. I wrote the code to create a paddle take in a position argument so that I can reuse the code to create multiple paddles in different positions.

Then I created the functions and event listeners to allow the paddles to move by using the up/down keys for the right paddle and “w”/”s” keys for the left paddle.
