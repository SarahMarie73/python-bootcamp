# Higher-Lower Game in Python

For this project, I broke it down into a bunch of TODOs, in which I then converted to comments as I finished each one.

I am finding that when I do this, it really helps keep me organized and on task. I make less mistakes and get less overwhelmed.  This was a really fun project that I completed within about and hour or two.

## Key concepts
- creating/using functions
- accessing values from a list of dictionaries
- python random() module

## Challenges experienced
Thanks to overcoming some challenges in a couple previous projects, I really didn't experience much for challenges.  I did have to research again how I was going to access the data from the dictionaries randomly from a list.
I can't stress enough how much creating todo's and breaking down the program into smaller tasks really helps.
